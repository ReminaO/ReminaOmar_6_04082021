## Description ##

This is the sixth exercise of OpenClassrooms' school. In this exercise I had to build the backend using a preconfigured frontend

## Installation ##

Clone the repo and follow the instructions for the backend and the frontend 

### Here are the dependancies you need to install for the backend:

- NodeJS 12.14 or 14.0
- Express
- jsonwebtoken

On Windows, these installations require to use PowerShell in administrator mode.

run `npm install` when it's done.

### Here are the dependancies you need to install for the frontend:

- NodeJS 12.14 or 14.0.
- Angular CLI 7.0.2.
- node-sass : make sure to use the corresponding version to NodeJS. For Noe 14.0 for instance, you need node-sass in version 4.14+.
On Windows, these installations require to use PowerShell in administrator mode.

The, clone this repo and run `npm install`.

## Usage ##

### For The Backend :

Run `node server`. This should run the local server.

The server should run on localhost with default `port 3000`.

### For the Frontend :

Run `npm start`. This should launch your browser.

If your browser fails to launch, or shows a 404 error, navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8080`.

The app should reload automatically when you make a change to a file.

Use Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop the local server.

If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the server starts, e.g. Listening on port 3001.
